So, like, I know it's kinda cliche, but mistakes are like, super important for success, you know? Like, I mean, think about it. If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new! \\n\\nI mean, like, think about it. When I was learning how to ride a bike, I fell off like, a million times. But, like, each time I got back up, I got better!  And now I can ride like, a total pro! \\n\\nBut, like, mistakes aren't just for learning how to ride a bike. They can be for, like, anything!  You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things don't go right, but that's okay! It's like, an opportunity to learn what went wrong and how to fix it! \\n\\nAnd, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff. Sometimes you might make a mistake, but if you don't get discouraged, you can learn from it and get better! \\n\\nSo, like, the next time you make a mistake, don't be all, like, \\\"Oh no, I'm a total failure!\\\"  Instead, be all, like, \\\"Okay, what can I learn from this? How can I improve?\\\" \\n\\nAnd, like, the more you practice, the better you'll get!  So, like, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Embrace them, because they're, like, totally part of the journey to success! \\n\\nSo, like, yeah. That's my essay.  I hope you liked it!\",\n          \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nAs you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.\\n\\nBut there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.\\n\\nIf these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n          \"The cafeteria at our school is an important resource for our students, offering meals that are both nutritious and tasty. With the same lunch menu options served every week, students may become bored with the same meals and make poor food choices. To add more variety to our cafeteria menu, we can provide three new meals each week that incorporate fresh, healthy ingredients. By offering more exciting options, students are more inclined to come to school and make more nutritional food choices.

Cars positively bring faster transportion within cities and areas of neccessity. Even though pople spend alot on gas to feed their cars, they see past that and proceed to use their vehicles. Although cars may offer easy access and convenience, they can affect the enviroment with the releasing of carbon gas emissions and smog, trapping in gas.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can benefit the enviroment and life of residents by ensuring them a safe area of living. If we can limit car usage it will greatly benefit us in different ways. Cars tend to drive people crazy. Traffic is a prime example where people can get frustrated. Whether you're in a rush in rush hour or having to get to some place you need, traffic can make you tense and unhappy. For example, Heidrun Walter, a resident from a car forbidden city - Vauban, Germany - said \\\" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. \\\", with this said you can conlude that car limitation can benefit us emotionally.\\n\\nTo get more in depth, Vauban is an experimental upscale community where streets attempt to be car free. This city is an example of what car limitation can be capable of. Cars have gases and carbon emission that are released when put in use. This can harm our atmosphere by trapping in greenhouse emssions. Statistics from experts demonstate that in Europe passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to an unbelievable 50 percent in the United States alone. The efforts of car limitation can be an advantage into stopping these gases from growing in the near future.\\n\\nParis, France is a smog filled European city due to the large congestion and diesel engines. On a Monday motorists with even-numbered plates had to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. Due to the restriction, congestion over the following five days was down 60 percent. Also opening up, wasthe free charge of the public transit. The restriction of cars opened up great advantages to decline the number of congestion which lowered the percentage of carbon emissions. If the population can take the limitations one period at a time the communities can experience cleaner air and healthier enviroments.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although cars are a covinient and easy way to get around, they can result in the harming of the enviroment and us as individuals. If we can all lower the emissions and sorts of congestions, the world and people can start to be happy knowing they're living in healthy enviroments with the inspirations of these cities such as Paris and Vauban.\\u00a0    \",\n          \" It's important that students have access to technology in the classroom because it allows them to stay connected with their families and receive important updates about what's happening at school. However, it's important to have clear guidelines and rules in place to ensure that students are not distracted by their devices and are able to focus on their studies.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of having technology in the classroom is that it allows students to stay connected with their families. This is especially important for students who may be away from their families for long periods of time, such as those who live far away or who are attending boarding school. By being able to communicate with their families regularly, students can feel more connected and supported, which can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall well-being.\\n\\nAnother benefit of having technology in the classroom is that it allows teachers to receive important updates about what's happening at school. For example, if there is an emergency or if there are changes to the school schedule, teachers can quickly and easily communicate this information to their students. This can help to ensure that students are aware of what's happening and are able to respond appropriately.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to have clear guidelines and rules in place to ensure that students are not distracted by their devices and are able to focus on their studies. For example, students may be required to turn off their devices during class or to only use them for educational purposes. This can help to ensure that students are able to fully engage with the material and that they are not constantly distracted by their devices.\\n\\nOverall, having technology in the classroom can be a valuable tool for students and teachers. However, it's important to have clear guidelines and rules in place to ensure that students are able to use their devices in a responsible and focused manner.\",\n          \"A good education is the most valuable aspect of a child's development; what we learn as youth affects us in our every day lives. The challenge that many kids face today is how they can best learn and retain material. Educators, professors, teachers, students, and parents alike are attempting to figure this out. In the past, when our parents were our age, there was a standard way of learning for everyone that was rigid and not as enjoyable as it is today. Now, there are many ways to learn: hands-on interactions, critical thinking emphasis, through games or logic, or by video call. You may ask yourself, what does it mean to learn via video? Essentially, some schools are offering kids to experience school from their homes by way of video conference. This may sound like fun to a kid, however, this type of learning limits kids capabilities and removes the core aspects of school. Distance learning dampens necessary social interactions, puts a unnecessary pressure on families, and does not guarantee the same learning environment as classrooms do.\\n\\nA key part of school is the importance of interacting and working with other students, making friends, and facing social challenges. In a classroom kids have to learn to work with others; often times for a project or classwork. Discovering the trait of working in a team or with others is something that people use in their everyday lives. Whether you're on a sports team, in a play, or working as an adult, you need to be able to work with others in order to achieve a common goal. Distance learning destroys social interactions and forces kids to rely only on themselves. Another great aspect of school is making new friends and facing social challenges. True friendship is one of the best feelings ever because they can have such a tremendous impact on your life and open your eyes to new things. Also, facing social challenges are crucial for maturation and set us up for success in the future. Social challenges include, but are not limited to: overcoming the fear of asking a girl on a date, facing mean people and things, and how to handle betrayal, rejection, and apologizing. All of these qualities of social interactions are very important for us to grow because all of these things are in our lives as adults. If you do not learn from an early age how to face and overcome these challenges, then you will be a miserable person for the rest of your life. Distance learning shatters all hopes of social interactions which harms kids in the future.\\n\\nAnother crucial aspect of schools is the burden that it releases from families. Many kids rely on the school to provide breakfast and lunch for them because many low-income families can not afford to pay for these meals. Kids also may require after-school care if their parents or guardians are not able to be at home when they get back from school. Distance learning limits both of these things. Parents who work would have to worry about their kids being home alone, and poorer families would have a harder time feeding their children. I do not think it is a good idea for kids to be alone at home, it puts an unneeded pressure especially on low-income families.\\n\\nLearning in a classroom also helps kids build self-control, patience, and the ability to learn from someone else in person. As we grow older, we learn many skills including self-control and patience from being in classrooms; we learn from discipline and through\\u00a0the teachers. Learning from home would hurt us because we would too comfortable at home and not develop these necessary skills. Also, I have found that learning material from someone else has a very lasting effect on people. I go to a camp in the summer and have been taught many things by my counselors and peers alike. Now, as a counselor myself, I teach others skills. This cycle of learning and teaching is very beneficial for the future. Distance learning may help kids learn but the in-person teachings are crucial for kids to develop and grow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning is an idea that harms students futures by limiting their social interactions, removing necessary things that the school provides, and taking away core aspects of learning and growing.\\u00a0   \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Seeking multiple opinions\",\n          \"Exploring Venus\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"human\",\n          \"AI\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"RDizzl3_seven\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

       " 'teenager girl get into a deadly car accident due to her self driving car shutting down this is one of the main reason why i am against driverless car yes having a self driven car could be fun and could help out some people but for others having a car that is supposed to drive itself could be not only boring and tiring but for me i would say that it would be dreadful and dangerous having a self driven car is a terrible idea to me i say that because what if you are driving and then something unexpected happens on the road that the car is unaware of and the car stopps working i dont know about you but that is one of my biggest fear i would hate to have a car and not know what could happen or what the car is capable of doing some may say that it a self diven car so it would never do that and that not knowing what are car is capable of doing is good but to me that is not good at all i hate not knowing everything there is to know about my car thats not only scary but it stressful too it build up stress and it make you feel like to have to be worried everytime you get into your car another reason why i say people should never get a self driven car is that it would be tiring like your in a car all day but your not driving it your litterally just sitting in a car waiting for something to happen so you could take over when im in a car sitting in the passenger seat i get tired a lot and i ofthen fall asleep now could you imagine be in the driver seat of a car rolling down the street not doing anything but looking out the window hoping something would happen and you could finally take over and start to drive just reading that sound tiring i would most defineatley fall asleep and then something would happen and then i would really be in trouble my last reason why i feel no one should ever get a self driven car is because no one want to have a car that they cant drive and i feel that that is exactly what you are getting when you are dealing with a self driven car i feel that you basically wated your hard earned money on a car that you have to wait to drive i say that because in the passage it clearly state that when you are in a driverless car all you have to do is look out for the car and then when something seem to be wrong you take over thats no fun to me and it would honestly make me mad having a driverless car is like having a sick baby you never know when it going to just stop working and you will never know whats wrong with it because it cant talk to you and it will never respond',\n",
       " 'education play an important role in the daily life of many youth many teenager value school a place where they can learn subject skill and topic a well a connect with teacher and classmate in most case student are required to be physically present in class however there are several occasion where student miss class some might not have access to transportation some might have emergency issue or some might be on vacation when they miss class sstudents might experience additional stress or anxiety a they struggle to stay on top of classwork now some school are offering distance learning a a solution distance learning allow studennts to work from home or other place outside of school through video or online conferencing distance learning is advantageous for student because student are able to attend class despite being in the middle of a difficult situation no access to transportation an emergency problem or a family vacation distance learning provides student who do not have access to transportation or live far away from school a way to learn transportation is one of the many challenge that teenager have to face while older youth might own car many student do not yet have access to car or other method of transportation therefore student find themselves frustrated when they are unable to attend necessary class in addition some student might live at a far distance from school these student who do not live close to their school may have to take additional time to get to their class often they are late and sometimes they miss their class through distance learning and online or video meeting student are able to learn the same material at home although they are not at school distance learning provides a similar setting to most classroom with the teacher lecturing and student listening frequently student will participate in activity in subject such a chemistry or physic because this enables student to learn the material that are needed it also reduces student frustration about having to catch up late work or assignment second distance learning can be a solution to student who have to face emergency issue emergency issue are a common problem and are often unexpected they can occur with close family member relative or friend in these occasion it is appropriate that the student are at the location a a result some student who might have been planning to attend class might not be able to distance learning allows student to virtually attend class at any time rather than in a set specific time therefore student who are dealing with emergency situation can be updated on the class whenever it is most suitable for them in this way student reduce the worry of struglling behind in class in conclusion distance learning allows student to not only take care of their close family and friend but also have access to education at the same time another occasion in which student might experience benefit from distance learning is when they are at a vacation or a location outside of their city or town many family plan a family vacation in the school year which require student to miss class when they return from their vacation however student find themselves in a devastating position with insurmountable amount of class work through online or video conferencing youth can attend class in any setting whether it is outside of town or outside the country because distance learning doe not require student to be physically present in the classroom student can eliminate their worry about being absent in class or missing a demonstration for example if a student is not able to attend his her english class for a book discussion they can easily connect online to participate in the activity with his her classmate therefore distance learning is an effective way that help help student learn no matter their location some opponent of distance learning might argue that online or video conferencing might not be a engaging a being physically present in a classroom for instance many science class assign lab with hand on activity for student to participate in however distance learning is a encouraging for student at home or other location a it is for student in class this is because in many case lab or any other activity often are done virtually online online website such a phet lab or any other reliable source offer student with visual simulation that exemplify real lab in addition even though student might not be able to participate in the full hand on experience they can still see demonstration and method on how to complete the experiment in conclusion school should offer distance learning a an option for student this action is necessary because student can learn important material in different setting and location outside of school whether they are unable to attend because of their distance from school emergency problem or vacation student can participate in activties and learn material through online or video conferencing furthermore student can work in engaging situation through online simulation although distance learning offer a new and different approach it still achieves the same purpose a a classroom by providing student with education',\n",

their own home and can even save time and energy for teacher and student alike nowadays many student suffer from some form of mental illness in fact in high school and middle school student suffer from some form of depression or anxiety in order to combat this raging epidemic online or video conferencing must be provided although some may say allowing online class can take away from the high school experience that however is flawed because many people have benefited from online class not only in grade but in mental health for example my friend generic name suffers from anxiety caused by recent school shooting and social interaction she constantly over think every social interaction and even think the person she is talking to is ridiculing them when in reality that is not the case she eventually did take an online class at the comfort of her own home which reduced a lot of the stress she had from school i saw a gradual increase in her mood if someone like her can improve many others can a well she wa no longer afraid of her previous fear another example is with myself when i wa injured during a wrestling tournament i wa gone away from school to recover i however wanted to continue my education so i would not be far behind when i came back i picked up a video conference call with my teacher and wa able to catch up with my classmate i wa relieved and wa stress free when i came back school should not only allow it but they should motivate their student in taking online class a an viable option with school becoming ever more competitive this ha put a tremendous amount of weight on not only student but teacher a well by allowing distance learning much of this unneeded stress can be lifted form their shoulder with online class come the ability to record a class in session compared to not being able to record a lecture from your teacher although some may say student may cheat or slack off during online class online class already have built in counter measure to mitigate those exact problem for instance i took an online class during the summer for algebra my class and i had to be all online at a certain time throughout the week the class only lasted for an hour and thirty minute with small quiz and lecture note i wa able to ask question and talk to my online teacher more effectively than i would have in a class in school i came out of it with a b overall and definitely learned more because of the online class not only that but my teacher who wa also taking care of her kid wa able to be a mother and teacher at the same time if there wa anything wrong on her end of the call she would quickly excuse her self and give u a small break time until she resolved any issue it wa flexible and effective school must encourage individual to take online class if they want to see improvement in their student i think everyone ha been there the point where you decide to go into lala land for a quick minute only to become lost in the lecture the teacher ha been giving scrambling to find out what just happened in online class teacher and student can record a lesson in any given moment it is way more convenient for the teacher and student to record a lecture than to restate everything that ha been said not only that but student can re watch or re listen to any part of the class to get a better understanding of the subject while some may say online class encourages shortcut to be made this however is flawed due to the fact that many student prefer and many more student end up passing online class more than a conventional class for example my friend and i had to make up an assignment over spring break we had the option to take an online video conference call with my english teacher to be retaught the subject my friend and i came in not wanting to do it since it wa spring break and i would rather play video game all day and stay outside past curfew with my friend however the video conference call changed the way i viewed my class and my own teacher i wa able to communicate and even joke around my teacher making her laugh it allowed for what i thought to be something serious to be something fun and enjoyable after spring break my friend and i became even more close and still visit my sophomore english teacher to this day in an age where technology is growing ever more prevalent with the old and young the school system is systematically failing it student by creating a stigma with online class and video conference there is a lot to be benefited for the youth especially now with these option in learning it not only solves many of the problem society face today but it can also bridge the gap between student and teacher teacher are getting out of touch with their student but by allowing online class more often than not student and teacher will grow to understand one another in a comfortable environment class should not be looked at with disdain from both party but should be looked at with optimism and positively in an already serious world society should bring back the fun in learning',\n",

year and she still remembered it so for her project she did something based on that quote she designed a poster where it show the quote and little picture of each class and showing what she liked

in his project he made a poster based on his teacher and something he said you believe in yourself you can accomplish anything what the world give you during those year he struggled with school he though he couldn t do it and he didn t even know what he wa going to do after high school but when he joined this mechanic class he fell in loved with everything all his time wa invested into mechanic his teacher saw potential in him when he first walked into class then one day his teacher called him up and asked what he want to do after high school he had no answer because he didnt know what to do so his gave him a opportunity to get an interview with this company he know and worked their before and at first he wa speechless because no one in that school believed in him and think that he wouldn t do nothing with his life so in the poster he wrote a passage on why he fell in love with that class and he added picture of him and his teacher working together it showed that with someone faith you can and you will achieve something great out of life if no believed in him then he wouldn t be working in that company that his teacher told him to join and he wouldnt be doing nothing in his life

but something about her made my friend and her have a connection my friend ha a mom that support her in everything but her spanish teacher never had a kid so my friend generic name wa like a daughter to her she felt like she had a bond like her mom then one day for parent s night generic name s mom went to her spanish class and her teacher and her mom clicked away they ve became best friend out of no where she wa surprised because she didnt know if they would like each other or something she thought wouldn t work out they ve been friend s for year already and have so much in common her teacher wa a person she can go for anything and without one question be afraid to tell her anything so for her project she did a poster of her mom and spanish teacher the connection they have no one in the world could have that her spanish teacher wa important to her because she felt alone sometimes and had no one to talk to and she felt like she can go to her and talk about her problem with her they have a bond she won t forget ever she added picture and saying thank you for everything for and nothing le and for helping her in her rough day and making them somewhat better if no one helped her in her bad time or no asked whats wrong then who know if she still be in school although some might think my friend generic name my brother generic name and my best friend generic name if they each didn t have a teacher who had faith in them who know what they would be doing right now they each had someone that cared and loved them when one wanna to i think having that special someone can do wonder

the topic being taught pairing this low concentration rate with distance learning including the use of online or video conferencing further worsens the issue although it may be said that distance learning provides accessibility or efficiency these factor compromise the quality of education that student receive long distance learning would not benefit student because of the low retention

people completing their tertiary education may not be able to afford these expensive repair long distance learning creates many way for student to miss a class or not fulfill a due date because of

opposed to a video or online note being in a classroom with the teacher engages a student more and can even provide motivation to learn compared to sitting at home and trying to absorb information through a video call a a part of long distance learning consequently there are countless distraction in the comfort of one s own home while in a classroom student are forced to stay focused and complete all task at hand in an educational setting the environment is everything on a psychological level individual have a relaxed and comforting connotation associated with their house and long distance learning at home creates a environment not suited for education on the other hand a classroom setting is ideal for focus and attention long distance learning is detrimental to an understanding of the topic because of the condition student attend the class in some may say that we live in an age of digitization and education must keep up with technological advance however this development should not come at the cost of student ability to comprehend their lesson after considering the claim made it is clear that long distance learning doe more harm than good in term of an

device to malfunction be attacked by a virus or simply break this is a waste of time and money that take away from the purpose of long distance learning not only is attending a class online unreliable

       " 'do you believe that your child should grow and learn with skill that are needed for everyday life attending school is very beneficial and can prepare you for the working environment that you will have to face in the future some may say that online class can be convenient for a student who ha a busy work schedule because they can attend class on their own time and won t have to spend most of the hour that are in a day to go to the actual school i believe that student would not benefit from attending online class because they wouldn t build social interaction skill they wouldn t know how to function in a work environment and they wouldn t have the work motivation to complete their assignment an important reason that cause online class to be unbeneficial is the inability to create social interaction skill when student attend school they have to communicate with other student and teacher therefore student learn how to correctly interact with others and build good relationship however if a student is taking class online they wouldn t be obligated to actually communicate with peer in person having the ability to talk to others is a very important skill for their working career in the future during a career you will be forced to interact with many people such a co worker costumer and client therefore attending school is a great way to obtain those skill by talking to other student and their teacher furthermore it is also a great way to build friendship with kid their age having friend can change the overall experience to a childhood because it can lead to a life necessity called fun life wouldn t be the same if i didn t have people that i could call my friend because learning can be more interesting if you re experiencing it with people you know and trust lastly when a student can build relationship with their teacher not only doe it give you an easier learning environment but it also provides an adult that you can ask question or talk to i have good relationship with many of my teacher therefore allowing me to have a great experience in school i am able to go to them if i ever need something or if i m confused about a certain topic relationship with teacher can also make or break your experience in your class when you look up to your teacher it s more likely for you to want to learn what they are teaching because you have respect for them overall having social interaction skill is very important for a good learning experience and for everyday life in the future another life necessity that a student would not obtain by taking online class is being able to function in a work environment many job and career require you to work under a schedule this being said if you are used to working at your own pace and on your own time you will not be prepared to be in the working environment unfortunately this can lead to the loss of your job and other opportunity because you can be considered unreliable furthermore if a student is used to working in a quiet area in their home they can be at risk of not knowing how to handle busy and loud work environment this can restrain them from being able to complete any of their work therefore making them insufficient when a place of business get extremely busy a lot of stress can be put on the employee attending school allows a person to be introduced to those type of condition at an early stage therefore making you more prepared for them than student who take online class online class do not prepare you for the real world which can lead to a rude awakening in the future lastly a lack of work motivation is another important reason to online class being unbeneficial compared to going to a school student can find it hard to get the motivation to complete their assignment with the flexibility of online class student can start getting the idea of pushing school work aside to focus on other thing unfortunately this mentality can get extremely out of hand for their grade can start to suffer and their work load can pile up many student experience this chain reaction therefore causing a lot of stress that can lead them to giving up having the access to attending a school decrease the ability to start this chain reaction because facing a teacher due to you not completing your work can be intimidating furthermore going to your class in person also give you more work motivation because most of time you don t have the option to sit around and do nothing your teacher encourage you to use your time wisely when you are given the opportunity to complete your assignment during class therefore giving student the extra push to actually do their work when student are able to work on their own schedule due to taking online class it open the opportunity to be lazy and not complete school work this lead to student drowning in work because of their lack of work motivation i think that student would not benefit from attending class from home because they wouldn t learn the ability to interact with people they wouldn t do well in a work environment and they wouldn t have the motivation to complete their work student who take online class are isolated therefore they are at larger risk to having rough experience in the future due to not being prepared for the real world they will not have the skill needed for everyday life which can lead them to failure however attending an actual school give you these life skill therefore giving you a better chance of being successful in the career of your choice you are also given the opportunity to making friend who can last a lifetime and building relationship with teacher who can guide you in the right direction to being successful in life a well',\n",

       " 'if you had to make a choice between going to school or attending class from home which would you choose a time pass this question will continue to be asked to student more and more the number of student that have begun learning from home keep increasing will we abandon our established educational system in search of a better one everyone ha their own thought and opinion regarding this matter but who is correct one thing is for certain no one know what will happen but based on the fact that are available right now we can assume that attending class from home is very beneficial student would benefit from being able to attend class from home because they would be able to work at their own pace and it would lead to an improved sleep schedule a benefit of being able to attend class from home is that it enables student to be able to work at their own pace for student who understand new concept relatively fast there would no longer be a reason to endure the hassle of having to wait for fellow classmate to catch up student who need more time would be able to learn at their own pace without having other student make them feel bad for taking too long allowing student to work at their own pace could also lead to a decrease in the possibility to lose focus when student are put into a classroom with other student who work at a completely different pace it can get difficult having to constantly put a stop to your learning or having no time to take a mental break because you are behind can make student lose focus learning from home provides student with the opportunity to take break and to be more focused being more focus is something very positive that could easily be improved by doing thing like having a good sleeping schedule having a better sleep schedule is another benefit of attending class from home a better sleep schedule is extremely beneficial to student not having to wake up early to go to school would allow student to sleep more it is common knowledge that one of the most debated topic regarding school is what time school should start extensive research ha shown that student would function better if school started later giving student the option to learn from home and wake up later would benefit them by allowing them to be more focus which would lead to them being more productive another reason a to why waking up early doe not work is because student often have to complete assignment that require a lot of time they go to sleep late to complete them on time going to sleep late and then having to wake up early is unhealthy attending class from home would increase the time student have on their hand so they would be able to complete assignment faster combining these two together we are able to see how drastically the sleep schedule of a student can improve although there are many positive with attending class from home people are always going to find negative a negative that people would argue for is that attending class from home wouldn t work because there is no real interaction between the student and the instructor they would argue that student would not be able to ask for help this sound like very reasonable remark but they can easily be proven wrong if a student ever need extra help or just want to ask a few question they could always schedule a conference via video calling with their instructor another way that a student can have his or her question answered is by simple looking it up online nowadays there are so many different website and youtube video that can be easily found regarding any subject student would have all the help they could need in conclusion student would benefit from attending class from home because their sleeping schedule would improve and they can work at their own pace not having to go to sleep late or wake up early would make it easier for student to have a more consistent and healthy sleep schedule decreasing the amount of distraction and not having to work at the rhythm of other classmate would make it possible for student to work at their own pace these two combined would be sufficient evidence a to why student would benefit from attending class from home so what would you do',\n",
       " 'dear principal you have listed two possible policy about cell phone at school the issue is common among all school considering that child are texting in class you have presented two very common idea about cell phone usage the first allows student to use their cell phone during lunch and other free time while your second suggests banning student from having phone at school while both idea can be considered good i personally believe that your first idea is the better of your suggestion if you ban the use of cell phone at school it cannot stop the student from bringing them you can stop child from using their phone on paper but this would not stop them from using them they could take out and use their phone when teacher are not watching and use them without being noticed and when somebody get caught they just get angry at the school and have their parent come up to the school to get back the confiscated phone this will give you no progress a student would still use their phone in class and just get them taken away even if they have the chance of getting caught they would still text or call somebody if they felt that it wa something important also student would have to use a school phone to contact a parent if they are sick or forgot something and not all teacher allow student to use class phone and if they do a sick person might use the class phone allowing the germ to spread possibly putting other student at harm of disease if student are allowed to use phone some point in the day then they might not use them a often in class student could then contact friend if they do not have the same free time a them and are able to contact a parent or guardian if they are sick this will cut down on student using class phone and will help stop texting going on in class if they believe they have the liberty to text during free time and lunch period then they will be le likely to text in class by giving them freedom you are helping yourself because they are le likely to break the rule if they have something to tell their friend or family and they do not need to break the school rule to tell them really quickly they would have time to do and say whatever they wanted to friend and family and that would cut down on student getting in trouble during class it would also reduce the amount of parent that have to come to school with complaint and to retrieve the item that wa taken away this will allow student to fell a if they more freedom treating them like adult if they feel they are treated like a grown person they might start to act like one this could improve their study if they stay more focused in class because they feel well respected this could also help they pay attention more in class if they are not texting during the teacher lesson the teacher can not always see if a student is texting so the pupil could easily get away with it during a free time student would be able to get all of their important text to their contact and be able to focus more in class this will improve the grade of student and help prevent student from being held back or failing a class it could even keep kid out of trouble if a student get bored after finishing their lunch or while outside then they could mess around and get in trouble but if they were allowed the privilege of their phone then they could avoid getting in by talking to their friend instead of goofing around over all i believe that banning phone from school is a bad idea none of the student would follow the rule and they would just bring them to school and hide them this will get zero progress and will create no change in the school environment if you let student text during free time it could keep student from texting during class and help them focus more by distracting the student while they are outside or have free time it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble and le people would be angry you would not have angry student or parent coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item thus not having to bother with any angry people this is where i stand on the policy but the final decision is up to you',\n",

there is bound to be many more mistake and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistake are catastrophic we should remove the system of the electoral college because it is questionable problematic and doe not represent well our democracy the electoral college us a group of people from each state number varying from each to represent voter in an election the voter mark down a candidate on a ballot however they are actually voting for a group of stranger to represent them many voter do not even realize that this is the case in politics there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measure to ensure that their idea somehow make it to power bribe and incentive could easily be given to elector in attempt to sway their vote speaking of these elector can be anyone who are not in a public office position emphasis on the anyone voter can never really be sure that they can trust those stranger who they did not even get to select once the vote have been counted voter cannot fully control who the elector actually vote for there have been instance where elector have attempted to completely avert the vote cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office it only seems logical that voter should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote this way there is le opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process in a group of segretationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing elector who supported john f kennedy with those who opposed him if this had happened all of the state electoral vote would have been cast by biased elector rather than by the actual voter themselves in the same year hawaii sent two state elector to congress instead of one it is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issue like this arise along with issue with the elector why is it that the size of a state automatically give it a bigger advantage in election texas and california are the most two saughtafter swing state in every election candidate will do everything they can to win over those electoral vote but what about the little state many of the smaller state do not get visited by candidate some never even see campaign ad this system we are using creates target area in the united state that are more valuable in election than others this is in no way fair to the voter in smaller state despite having the exact same right a voter of bigger state the electoral college is proving to be le and le

president bush won out in our constitution it is written that citizen of the united state have an unwavering right to vote and select who get put into office in this case it sound more like the number of electoral vote ha an unwavering right to select who get put into office this go against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and in many way make it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their right for a many frustratingly resolvable problem that are created by the electoral college there are certain thing about the electoral college that could possibly make it worth keeping for instance there technically is no region of the country that ha enough electoral vote to vote a president into office so no one area of the control large number of vote along with this the system help avoid runoff election which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner however having a straightforward election where the vote come straight from citizen is most constitutional and much le problematic the process ha been used for a long time in our country but it is time to make a change the electoral college ha proven to be more trouble than it s worth our

some believe otherwise student should be able to design their own project because they will have the creativity factor that controlled project would not they can choose their own subject and they have an increased growth in responsibility u student love the creativity aspect of getting to choose how we get to work we hate being bound to guideline and rule set by other people whenever i get to choose how i do my project i always seem to do better on them when i get to be more creative a couple of month ago my ap environmental science teacher let u choose an end of year project she said a long a you get it in on time i do not care what or how you do it the project just ha to pertain towards some of the topic that we learn during the course i loved getting that freedom from her because i got to do it how i wanted and i got to be more creative with it too i ended turning in that project within a month because it wa something that i wanted to do if i wa bound to the rule i would have procrastinated until the night before it wa due some may disagree saying that they are more likely to do the project when guideline are given and when student are forced not to be creative that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that my friend generic name wa given a similar project but with guideline saying the stuff that she could and could not do she ha always been better than me at turning in assignment when i found out that i had turned in my project before her i wa astonished i asked her why she had not not done yet she said that she had not even figured out what she wa going to do she wa bound to do what she wa told to do and she lost the creativity factor that she ha always loved creativity is vital to a student success when doing project it ensured that every project is different and more entertaining than traditional project getting to choose a subject also make the project more enjoyable for the student if student were given a choice to select a subject that they would do a summer project on they would most likely choose the subject that they feel more confident in my mother always say that she loved to do project on history which wa her favorite subject when she wa in high school she said that whenever she would get to do a project on it she would get a s and b s every time but she would get c s on other project that wa not on her favorite subject this choice in subject wa a morale booster for her when she got good grade she got more confident and when she got more confident she got better grade the choice correlated with her mental health and her school life because she always felt good about her work some say that if we get assigned a subject then we will be more likely to do what the person who grade is looking for that is not the case because of my friend generic name generic name had to do a summer project last year and he had no idea what to do he called me an asked what my project wa on i told him that me and just about everyone in our friend group wa doing our project on history when the school year started i asked him what he did it on and he said his project wa on economics when we got our grade back he had gotten the highest out of all of our friend this just show that it is more likely for someone to get a better grade when they get to choose a project subject or topic that they enjoy to do in our youthful society responsibility is a huge part of maturing getting to choose a project make kid more responsible in the long run this past weekend my parent left me home while they went to go watch my sister play lacrosse at generic school in rhode island i stayed home with my dog and had a lot of time to myself and to my study i could have pushed it off until sunday night but i decided to do the responsible thing and do it during the day on saturday the choice i made wa the right one because i had the rest of the weekend to myself and got to relax and not stress about having to do my homework if i can choose to be responsible now then i can be responsible when it come to a summer project i think that growth in responsibility will also have a great effect on everyone that doe this project the responsible person would choose to do the project earlier in the summer but the kid that procrastinate will stress about this until the day before the project is due some think that responsibility ha nothing to do with this project that is not true we are trusted to be responsible young men woman or however people identify themselves this project is not just about learning at school but learning about life when given the choice to do the project how we want to do it responsibility play a huge factor factor like will we get it done on time how will we do it what topic will we do it on and if the project actually had time spent on it or if it wa just sped through u student need to be responsible in order to get in to good college get good job and live good life it all start with project like these when all of these factor are put together they are more likely to make u more responsible in the long run when we get to choose what we do for project like these it make everyone feel good about what they are turning in it could be the coffee in my system talking but u student have responsibility and we need to start being trusted and treated like adult we want to be creative like adult think like adult and live like adult it all start with letting u choose a subject for our project after all we are the future of society',\n",

       " 'homework during the summer that is a student worst nightmare now instead of relaxing on a beach care free they have to worry about an assignment although student might not like this summer project are actually really beneficial for them because it help them stay in learning mode and be ready to learn more when they go back to school but who should design the project student or teacher if student design the project it would be a complete waste of time the idea of this doe not make sense at all because teacher are the one who are supposed to teach and student are the one who are supposed to learn teacher should be the one designing summer project because the project will actually help student learn the topic there will be more stress put on student if they have to create their own project and the project will help student be prepared for the next school year some might argue that if the kid were allowed to design the project they would chose something that interest them and would make them want to do the assignment however this would be very unwise because even though the project would interest them the topic might still be irrelevant which would eliminate the whole point of the assignment this is a risk not worth taking because though some kid would design beneficial project there would also be those who hate the idea and would pick something easy to get it over with along with this most of the time teacher give student many choice to pick from this mean that out of all the choice a student can pick one that appeal to them the most making the project le of a chore to begin with giving student a teacher designed project would be the best thing to do because the project would help student learn the topic what is a teacher job to teach so one is right to think that a teacher designed project would only serve beneficial to student for example if a teacher give his or her class a book reading project where they have to read a book and create a presentation about it the student would read a book that relates back to the class and would make them understand the topic better by doing this teacher give student an alternative than sitting in class writing everything on a paper if a student wa given the task of creating a project like this they would fail to make it beneficial teacher are older which mean they are wiser so they will create project based off experience they know the best way to teach from the year of teaching this mean that they would only design a project that is beneficial for student moving on student will go through more stress if they are given the task to create and complete a project rather than the teacher doing it this is clear to see because of the time it is the teacher giving work so this change can be hard for student to adapt to for example if a kid ha many activity such a sport and traveling going on during the summer he will be more worried about the assignment because now he ha to think of an original project to create which is harder than just completing one given to you student already have to go through the hardship of having a summer assignment if they were assigned to also creating the project they would have an increase in the level of stress they receive this is because now they have to do something they are not used to and that is more difficult a well this type of stress can lead to student losing interest in social activity which in turn can lead to many negative outcome such a lower grade family problem and eventually depression last but not least teacher designed project will lead to student being more prepared for the upcoming school year obviously the teacher know more than the student about the class so they will know what the kid should be studying for example if a history teacher know that next year the class will learn about world war then he or she will assign a project which ha the student research world war where a if student were given the choice to design their own project the chance of it being related to what they do next year would be very low this mean that when the student go to school the following year he or she will not be prepared for what they have to learn which lead to them not doing a well a others and having lower grade ultimately this is humiliating for the kid and angering because he or she just spent a good part of their summer creating this project which in return ha no value this could all be avoided if teacher designed project were given to every student all in all teacher designed project prove to serve better than student designed one teacher are the one that know all the information about their class so letting them design the project is the only logical solution student should be given teacher designed project to complete over the summer because the project will be helpful since the teacher already know the topic making it so that the student will learn from it there will be le stress put on student if they are given a project designed by teacher and the project will help student be prepared for the next school year looking at the bigger picture by not making student create

happened and i can t take it back i got caught and now i have to do the right thing i whip out my phone and press the face time button to talk to my best friend about what is going on hey generic name i managed to say while holding back tear i really need your advice on something i say more serious now but facing the camera towards the ceiling okay what s up she reply sounding concerned i talked about generic name behind her back with a few other people and i said some pretty hurtful thing the only reason i said those thing is because everybody else wa and i don t know i start rambling and need to slow down anyways she messaged me this morning saying that she found out what i said and it really hurt her feeling now i feel awful and i need your advice on how to apologize i squeaked were the other girl talking bad about her too generic name asked yeah even worse than me i yelp that s not what i heard she start but i cut her off short wait what you already heard about this she chuckle while managing to say yeah almost everybody ha heard but they said it wa just you being mean and i believe them i can feel the tear streaming down my face a i end the call without replying to her people should seek multiple opinion when in need of advice because it will not be a bias they might not know any better than you and you can hear from people who have different meaning in your life first off you should seek multiple opinion when in need of advice because the advice will not be a bias when you seek advice from someone you want to know what they would do in your shoe but sometimes they might not tell you the full truth because they are bias for example my little brother generic name really wanted a monster truck for his birthday he decided to ask his friend if that is what he should ask for just so that he doesn t regret it well it turn out that his friend also really wanted a monster truck but his birthday wasn t for month so his friend told him not to ask for it because he would regret it but the real reason is because he didn t want generic name to get it first this is why you should seek more than one opinion because the person you ask for help might not actually want to help you just themselves for instance my neighbor generic name went on a trip to hawaii with her friend while she wa there she got into an argument with one of them and she felt really bad afterwards so she asked a different friend named generic name what she should do generic name said that she should quit worrying a much and not do anything for the friend she wa arguing with little did generic name know that generic name didn t like the friend she argued with which is why he told her not to do anything about it luckily generic name wa smart enough to ask another friend who said she should get the friend flower generic name decided to get the flower and they made up this is just example of why you shouldn t just ask one person for advice they could be completely bias and you wouldn t even notice next you should seek multiple opinion when in need of advice because the person might not know any better than you picture this generic name is in hawaii with her friend and they came across a cliff that lead into the water if you jumped off most of her friend convinced generic name to go first right when generic name wa getting ready to jump one of her friend stopped her and said they would go check the water first to make sure there weren t any rock turn out there were ton and that could have seriously injured generic name if she had listened to her other friend her friend did not want her to get hurt they just didn t know any better a further example is when my mom went to get grocery and forgot what kind of yogurt we get and called me to check i asked my little brother to do it for me and he said it wa the light and fit brand and it wa organic so that is what i told my mom i decided to double check to be sure and found out that it wa also gluten free so i immediately told my mom the correct kind now this would have resulted poorly because my dad is allergic to gluten and he eats that yogurt a lot once again sometimes people aren t trying to give you bad advice or make you do the wrong thing they just do not know any better which is why you always should have multiple opinion finally you should seek multiple opinion when in need of advice so you can hear from people who have different meaning in your life what i mean by this is when you really need advice and nobody is available besides a peer you barely talk to than their advice will not have enough meaning or importance to even consider what they are saying for instance if they tell you that they think you were in the wrong you might think that they don t even know you that well so why would they be right even if they are right about you being wrong which is why you have to hear multiple opinion if you just hear from that person that doesn t have meaning in your life you will only agree with them if you like what you are hearing rather than if you talk to your older sister about it and they say that you are in the wrong you are way more likely to consider that and believe it study show that out of people say they would always believe a best friend over a coworker no matter what the situation is in conclusion i decided to ask my friend generic name for advice because she doesn t go to my school and won t be a bias she told me i should apologize to generic name and tell her the full truth generic name thanked me and cleared up everything people should seek multiple opinion when in need of advice because it won t be a bias they might not know any better than you and you can hear from people with different meaning in your life',\n",

Cars positively bring faster transportion within cities and areas of neccessity. Even though pople spend alot on gas to feed their cars, they see past that and proceed to use their vehicles. Although cars may offer easy access and convenience, they can affect the enviroment with the releasing of carbon gas emissions and smog, trapping in gas.\\n\\nLimiting car usage can benefit the enviroment and life of residents by ensuring them a safe area of living. If we can limit car usage it will greatly benefit us in different ways. Cars tend to drive people crazy. Traffic is a prime example where people can get frustrated. Whether you're in a rush in rush hour or having to get to some place you need, traffic can make you tense and unhappy. For example, Heidrun Walter, a resident from a car forbidden city - Vauban, Germany - said \\\" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. \\\", with this said you can conlude that car limitation can benefit us emotionally.\\n\\nTo get more in depth, Vauban is an experimental upscale community where streets attempt to be car free. This city is an example of what car limitation can be capable of. Cars have gases and carbon emission that are released when put in use. This can harm our atmosphere by trapping in greenhouse emssions. Statistics from experts demonstate that in Europe passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to an unbelievable 50 percent in the United States alone. The efforts of car limitation can be an advantage into stopping these gases from growing in the near future.\\n\\nParis, France is a smog filled European city due to the large congestion and diesel engines. On a Monday motorists with even-numbered plates had to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. Due to the restriction, congestion over the following five days was down 60 percent. Also opening up, wasthe free charge of the public transit. The restriction of cars opened up great advantages to decline the number of congestion which lowered the percentage of carbon emissions. If the population can take the limitations one period at a time the communities can experience cleaner air and healthier enviroments.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although cars are a covinient and easy way to get around, they can result in the harming of the enviroment and us as individuals. If we can all lower the emissions and sorts of congestions, the world and people can start to be happy knowing they're living in healthy enviroments with the inspirations of these cities such as Paris and Vauban.\\u00a0    \",\n          \" It's important that students have access to technology in the classroom because it allows them to stay connected with their families and receive important updates about what's happening at school. However, it's important to have clear guidelines and rules in place to ensure that students are not distracted by their devices and are able to focus on their studies.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of having technology in the classroom is that it allows students to stay connected with their families. This is especially important for students who may be away from their families for long periods of time, such as those who live far away or who are attending boarding school. By being able to communicate with their families regularly, students can feel more connected and supported, which can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall well-being.\\n\\nAnother benefit of having technology in the classroom is that it allows teachers to receive important updates about what's happening at school. For example, if there is an emergency or if there are changes to the school schedule, teachers can quickly and easily communicate this information to their students. This can help to ensure that students are aware of what's happening and are able to respond appropriately.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to have clear guidelines and rules in place to ensure that students are not distracted by their devices and are able to focus on their studies. For example, students may be required to turn off their devices during class or to only use them for educational purposes. This can help to ensure that students are able to fully engage with the material and that they are not constantly distracted by their devices.\\n\\nOverall, having technology in the classroom can be a valuable tool for students and teachers. However, it's important to have clear guidelines and rules in place to ensure that students are able to use their devices in a responsible and focused manner.\",\n          \"A good education is the most valuable aspect of a child's development; what we learn as youth affects us in our every day lives. The challenge that many kids face today is how they can best learn and retain material. Educators, professors, teachers, students, and parents alike are attempting to figure this out. In the past, when our parents were our age, there was a standard way of learning for everyone that was rigid and not as enjoyable as it is today. Now, there are many ways to learn: hands-on interactions, critical thinking emphasis, through games or logic, or by video call. You may ask yourself, what does it mean to learn via video? Essentially, some schools are offering kids to experience school from their homes by way of video conference. This may sound like fun to a kid, however, this type of learning limits kids capabilities and removes the core aspects of school. Distance learning dampens necessary social interactions, puts a unnecessary pressure on families, and does not guarantee the same learning environment as classrooms do.\\n\\nA key part of school is the importance of interacting and working with other students, making friends, and facing social challenges. In a classroom kids have to learn to work with others; often times for a project or classwork. Discovering the trait of working in a team or with others is something that people use in their everyday lives. Whether you're on a sports team, in a play, or working as an adult, you need to be able to work with others in order to achieve a common goal. Distance learning destroys social interactions and forces kids to rely only on themselves. Another great aspect of school is making new friends and facing social challenges. True friendship is one of the best feelings ever because they can have such a tremendous impact on your life and open your eyes to new things. Also, facing social challenges are crucial for maturation and set us up for success in the future. Social challenges include, but are not limited to: overcoming the fear of asking a girl on a date, facing mean people and things, and how to handle betrayal, rejection, and apologizing. All of these qualities of social interactions are very important for us to grow because all of these things are in our lives as adults. If you do not learn from an early age how to face and overcome these challenges, then you will be a miserable person for the rest of your life. Distance learning shatters all hopes of social interactions which harms kids in the future.\\n\\nAnother crucial aspect of schools is the burden that it releases from families. Many kids rely on the school to provide breakfast and lunch for them because many low-income families can not afford to pay for these meals. Kids also may require after-school care if their parents or guardians are not able to be at home when they get back from school. Distance learning limits both of these things. Parents who work would have to worry about their kids being home alone, and poorer families would have a harder time feeding their children. I do not think it is a good idea for kids to be alone at home, it puts an unneeded pressure especially on low-income families.\\n\\nLearning in a classroom also helps kids build self-control, patience, and the ability to learn from someone else in person. As we grow older, we learn many skills including self-control and patience from being in classrooms; we learn from discipline and through\\u00a0the teachers. Learning from home would hurt us because we would too comfortable at home and not develop these necessary skills. Also, I have found that learning material from someone else has a very lasting effect on people. I go to a camp in the summer and have been taught many things by my counselors and peers alike. Now, as a counselor myself, I teach others skills. This cycle of learning and teaching is very beneficial for the future. Distance learning may help kids learn but the in-person teachings are crucial for kids to develop and grow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning is an idea that harms students futures by limiting their social interactions, removing necessary things that the school provides, and taking away core aspects of learning and growing.\\u00a0   \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"human\",\n          \"AI\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 921,\n        \"min\": 334,\n        \"max\": 18125,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3930,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2819,\n          995\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lexical_diversity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08442971018925712,\n        \"min\": 0.052298850574712646,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13117,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.3110539845758355,\n          0.5327635327635327\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flesch_reading_ease\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 17.14839743846885,\n        \"min\": -434.51,\n        \"max\": 103.73,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1962,\n        \"samples\": [\n          32.53,\n          80.14\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
