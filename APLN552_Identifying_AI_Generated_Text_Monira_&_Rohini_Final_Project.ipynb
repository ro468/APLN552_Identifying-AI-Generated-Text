So, like, I know it's kinda cliche, but mistakes are like, super important for success, you know? Like, I mean, think about it. If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new! \\n\\nI mean, like, think about it. When I was learning how to ride a bike, I fell off like, a million times. But, like, each time I got back up, I got better!  And now I can ride like, a total pro! \\n\\nBut, like, mistakes aren't just for learning how to ride a bike. They can be for, like, anything!  You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things don't go right, but that's okay! It's like, an opportunity to learn what went wrong and how to fix it! \\n\\nAnd, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff. Sometimes you might make a mistake, but if you don't get discouraged, you can learn from it and get better! \\n\\nSo, like, the next time you make a mistake, don't be all, like, \\\"Oh no, I'm a total failure!\\\"  Instead, be all, like, \\\"Okay, what can I learn from this? How can I improve?\\\" \\n\\nAnd, like, the more you practice, the better you'll get!  So, like, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Embrace them, because they're, like, totally part of the journey to success! \\n\\nSo, like, yeah. That's my essay.  I hope you liked it!\",\n          \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nAs you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.\\n\\nBut there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.\\n\\nIf these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n          \"The cafeteria at our school is an important resource for our students, offering meals that are both nutritious and tasty. With the same lunch menu options served every week, students may become bored with the same meals and make poor food choices. To add more variety to our cafeteria menu, we can provide three new meals each week that incorporate fresh, healthy ingredients. By offering more exciting options, students are more inclined to come to school and make more nutritional food choices.

to each method of voting the electoral college ha been around since the beginning of our country most of the time it is successful there have been a few time problem have occured but rarely it happens a time ha passed and we enter a more modern age people have started to feel that the electoral college doe not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote however even though there have been a few problem in the past about this system the electoral college is still the best method of voting it is hard to argue that there are some problem with the electoral college under the electoral college system voter vote not for the president but for a slate of elector who in turn elect the president bradford plumer the public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of elector that decide the fate of the presidency the electoral college method is not emocratic in a modern sense richard a posner the public is also starting to feel that this is not a true democracy with this system consider that state legislature are technically responsible for picking elector and that those elector could always defy the will of the people bradford plumer the public is starting to not like that feeling that the elector can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want and it ha happened a few time in the past faithless elector have occasionally refused to vote for their party s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please bradford plumer that is another worry of the public no matter what party the elector belongs to they can vote for anyone they want perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote in that case the elcetion would be thrown to the house of representative where state delegation vote on the president bradford plumer the people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people ha a much to say a an elector representing million of people all and all it is hard to deny that there are a few problem with the electoral college and that this cause the public to worry come election time however despite the worry and concern that some people may have the electoral college is still the best method for voting the founding father established it in the constitution a a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote the office of the federal register people must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problem among the government again the public must also remember that each party selects a slate of elector trusted to vote for the party s nominee richard a posner this system also can often prevent dispute a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible but it s le likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidate s share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote richard a posner along with the fewer dispute it also creates standard for the candidate the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal this is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president richard a posner another benefit to this system is that it cause voter to pay closer attention to the election voter in toss up state are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign richard a posner along with the more aware voter the electoral college is also very beneficial to the big state the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large state by population lose by virtue of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution richard a posner and lastly the electoral collee help avoid run off election there is pressure for run off election when no candidate win a majority of the vote cast that pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process is reduced by the electoral college which invariably produce a clear winner richard a posner to sum it all up there are many benefit to the electoral college all and all the electoral college is the best way for voting with this system there are many benefit to the election process that people may not realize with benefit like it avoids run off election and it make the voter more aware some people still beleive that a popular vote is still the best way it is important to

fashion most people have a certain topic hobby or sport that they know a lot about so asking multiple people for their opinion can help you make the right decision because you might find someone that ha a lot of knowledge on the topic you re asking about another example is if someone wa asking me what instrument they should choose to play i could give them a lot of information because i play an instrument but if they asked someone who ha no knowledge on music and doesn t play an instrument they wouldn t get a lot of information you might not know your friend have a lot of knowledge on a topic until you ask them simply asking multiple people for their opinion can spark a conversation in which you learn a lot about the topic when people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different point of view for example if you re asking people for advice about what you should do when you have a problem with your friend some people might tell you to go to a counselor and work it out and some people might just tell you to talk to the person about it when you ask different people for their opinion you can see how many people have the same opinion on a topic and how many people disagree with it if everybody you ask about a topic ha a certain opinion but only one person disagrees you wouldn t just go with the one person disagreeing if you only ask that one person about the topic then you could ve made the wrong choice but if you ask multiple people for their point of view you can make the right choice and get more insight furthermore when a lot of people have the same opinion on something it is most likely the right choice when people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different experience people have different experience and their experience can cause them to have more wisdom than others for example if you ask people on advice about where you should travel you might find people who have a lot of experience traveling and they can give you their opinion and share their wisdom if you only asked one person and that person ha never even left the country then you aren t getting a wise reliable opinion another example is if you re asking an adult or a professional about the topic then they are clearly more wise because they are either specialized in that field or simply have lived longer and have more experience in general people who have a lot of wisdom are responsible and reliable they ll think about the outcome of your decision and all the possible negative this make them really good people to ask for advice and they ll probably choose the best option for you generic name go to m generic name s office to ask her if he could take his schedule paper back she give him the paper back and asks him if he need any advice generic name say yes actually i wa wondering if you could help me decide if i should take a lot of ap class or not of course you should only take ap class for the class you re really interested in and have a b or higher m generic name explains oh that make sense i think i m going to take ap bio ap geometry and ap world history because those are my favorite class and i have a good grade in all of them generic name say m generic name reply now that sound like a way better option than what you chose before generic name chuckle he is dismissed to go back to

said it really hard and you get a ton of homework every day generic name explains generic name responds oh okay thank you i would ve had no idea if i didn t ask you now generic name ha a lot more

just supported by the violated environment but along with that society is an advocate for the pain of the people an intrugal part of the current society is the usage of car with the progressing world also come regress and according to an article written by the new york time in it wa stated that in country such a the united state of america american are buying le and getting fewer license a each year go by this eventually ha lead to a limiting in car usage in the u s a although the car industry may suffer from this it is essential to note that the limiting in car usage doe not really have a negative impact on the public in fact in the long run the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society a a whole this can be seen in three major way with first public benefit second cheaper and timesaving method and finally the unmatched environmental benefit a people continue to choke from the pain it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem and limiting car usage is the definitely one of the best way to reduce the harm the public benefit can be broken down into reduced stress more space and increased safety starting off with stress heidrun walter a mother of two child stated that she wa always tense when she had a car she now life in the german city of vauban here most people have given up on car including mr walter a a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation with mr walter businessman carlos arturo plaza stated that it s a good opportunity to take away stress these people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit moving toward space an article written by elisabeth rosenthal in state in this new approach we will have make it so there is le space for parking with le space for car there is more space for people not only that but with the increased limit there is a decrease in traffic traffic can be extremely long and in this case it will help to increase public space although traffic doe not pose threat to the people safety in the long term car accident do pose a major threat therefore with their limit there can be an increase in safety for the people moving back to mr walter she a a mother of two did want the best for her child and above all come their safety meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produce although people do want to benefit a individual it really come down to the cost at the end point but limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person in fact by limiting car alternate transportation is promoted country such a colombia have move on to bicycle the major of bogotaa city in colombia said that due to the limitation of car for a day it ha seen the constuction of mile of bicycle path this is cheaper because the price og bicycle are pale in comparison to car this mean that transport would be so much more affordable now with the increase in bicycle travel there would hardly be any large amount of traffic and although car are much faster than bicycle the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel bicycle travel will be more efficient this ultimately mean that by limiting car usage transportation will be cheaper and it will be just a efficient if not more it can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel but david goldberg an offical of transportation for america said that in country such a the u s a of appropriation have gone to highway this ultimately set the stone for the construstion of these lane by limiting car usage these appropriation can be set aside for other mean of transportation indeed in the end vauban is correct in calling this smart planning now come out the benefit everyone know about the environmental benefit smog ha been one of the largest problem that is choking the people around the world in country such a china it is elementary that those people a facing large amount of smog daily but what may not be a common to people is that a country such a france ha also started to see a similiar problem pollution in france is actually rivaled by beijingone of the most polluted

named the end of car culture state that car are one of the highest source for carbon emission by limiting car usage city such a bogota and paris faced amazing result overall by limiting car usage the

              " 'most student would love the idea of being able to learn and be at home while doing it i do think that student would benefit from doing online schooling instead of going to school everyday one reason i agree with i distance learning is because you can wake up at a time you would like to and be able to do school at your own pace not having to wake up at a certain time to make sure that you can catch the bus or make it to school on time without getting a tardy or an unexcused pas for being late to school another reason is the passing and graduating rate would go up because child would be in their own space and wouldn t be told what to do or when to do it the reason why most kid do not come to school today is because they feel a if school start to early and they dont get enough sleep and the result of that is not being able to focus in class and and causing them to fall asleep in class study have shown that the brain doesn t start to fully function until ten o clock in the morning most teenager do not go to sleep until one or two o clock in the morning so when they have to wake up at five o clock or maybe even four in the morning to catch the bus they wont go which cause them to miss important work and class that they need to graduate a a teenager they tend to have a lot put on them at a young age most of them have job or have to look after somebody at home that isn t including the homework and project that they get from teacher working a a teenager and being a full time student can be hard because you have to balance the two of them for example if a teen ha to look after their sick grandmother because that once wa their caregiver they should not have to leave home just to come to school when they can stay home and still learn the same thing they would if they were in school more school should offer online schooling or maybe even just trying it out to see how many student would actually use it and see if that make a change in that system i think most kid would appreciate the fact that people think about them and how they have other stuff going on in their life kid would be happier the grade would appear better and it would relive a lot of stress for not only the kid but the teacher also because the teacher have to wake up earlier than the kid do just to be at school and teach when they can be in the own comfort of their home but still teaching it would help a lot of people and would not cause them to drop out online schooling could also be a bad thing because most kid stay at home all day and do nothing already so having them stay home for school could be making it worse having them up everyday for school is not only getting them out the house but getting them active a well mostly all teenager are on their phone in front of the television or playing video game a soon a they get home up until they go to bed so having them going to school and not being able to have their phone in school is a good thing in conclusion online schooling should be avavbile to all the school around the world not only would it help the student struggling to make it to the bus or school on time it will help them be smarter and better them in all aspect their grade will show it the test score will be higher and all homework will get done everybody will be more focused and not distracted kid wont be in trouble a much and they will get the help that they actually need because everybody will be in their own home and they wont be afraid to say they need help',\n",

a student designed project would be vastly more effective a project designed by the student would guide them to putting more effort into it it would help teach some independence and would be le of a chore to the student because the project are student designed the student will feel a greater sense of responsibility for it and will put more effort into it which will up the quality of the project when a student feel responsible for a project they will go to greater length to ensure that they do it right and that it turn out good no one want something that is entirely their own to turn out bad the student will have greater creative liberty with how they execute it this flexibility will accomodate every student no matter how they learn best wether it be writing a paper painting a picture creating a diagram or making a website the student would be able to learn in whatever way they do best no matter what that way may be student will be better at ensuring that all detail of the project are included if they are the one to decide what the project includes there is no way they can fall short of the information required making it a student led project will allow the student to take a significant amount of pride in it that doe not come with other project having the student design their own project would allow the student to try new style of project perhaps the teacher they have do not assign a specific type of project that a student really enjoys the student would be able to do that type of project the student could also have the desire to try a new style of project the project that are assigned at school can often be redundant or generally overdone having the student design their own project will allow the student to try something new and possible adopt a preferred way of completing project having the student do the project that they want to so will also help communicate to the teacher what the student want when a teacher see a new and unique way of leaning they could potentially use it in the future a a new and more captivating way of teaching having the student design a project will force them to come up with their own requirement this will be a wonderful chance for the student to obtain some independance that is not really offered at school usually when assigned a project there is a paper that ha all of the requirement layed out in a convenient guidline for the student to follow between the guidline and the teacher constant presence the project loses a majority of it independance having a project that is entirely up to the student will allow the student to learn to be more independant which will come in handy later on in life student designed mean every aspect they would be able to base their project on whatever they want this would give them an opportunity to research something that they don t already know anything about often student cannot pursure their interest because of all their other responsibility many student cannot take the class that they wish to take becuase they have other class that they are required to complete in order to graduate becuase there is no determined subject of the project the student will have the rare chance to research whatever they want to this could even be a time where the student could learn something that is not taught in school at all this also applies to class that they may be taking that they do not do many project in this would give them the chance to use and display the knowledge that they already have similarly to the style of project upon seeing all of the topic that interest the student the teacher may be inclined to add some of the topic to their curriculum which would once again encourage the student to be more interested in their class when one student is interested in something it is more than likely that other student will be the same though it is important for student to work with topic that are already somewhat familiar to them it s also very important for student to step outside of their comfort zone into something entirely new when a student begin learning about a topic with an open mind and a goal to learn they may find more than a project they may find a passion it s very important to allow student to explore new interest while still in highschool being in the smae routine for year may put a student into the mindset that they should not change what they are already doing or it could even discourage student from pursuing new interest it is important that student find these interest so that they will have an idea of what they want to do when they go to college or when they step out into the world a adult student should be able to design their own project rather than teacher student designed project will push them to put more effort into in to achieve some independence and to generally care more about what they are learning especially now day the curriculum in more so about teaching what will be on the standardized test that we must pas in order to graduate rather that the interest that the student actually have the mindset that we must prepare student by not allowing them to pursue their own interest need to stop we should strive to make learning more fun and cater the the interest of the student when student know what they enjoy they will be more prepared for the future in which they will not be stuck doing a job that they do not enjoy to live a life that ha little interest to them one of the biggest issue right now with highschoolers is that they have no idea what they want to do with their future',\n",

              " 'many public and private school have advanced in many way throughout the past decade school all around the world have weaved technology advancement into the classroom and outside of the class room to help get student more actively involved in school related activity and lesson technology is a blessing and curse which mean it help teacher teach but also in certain aspect it worsens the attention span of younger child diving deeper into this world wide technology advancement that is happening there is this one main question that get asked quite a lot by administrator all around the world would student work harder and better if they could attend class from home virtually online or through video conferencing my full opinion to that is no study show that almost of people work better in a room full of other peer although the isolation and focus you may have at your own home is nice and relaxing in order for a person to fully develop into a knowledgeable student they have to have social skill community awareness and be able to understand eye to eye learning you can truly only achieve these three skill if you attend school physically not virtually that is why student would not benefit at all through at home learning than they would at school in order for all student to successfully climb up the social ladder they need to have one major trait that can help all peer make connection bond and even relationship this skill is called social skill there wa a study done at workman state college where scientist studied student who stayed home for the whole school day and then studied student who actually went to school for the whole day both group of student were learning the same material the group at home got a video of their teacher explaining everything exactly the same a what she taught in class half of student at home did not talk to a single person the whole day that they were at home meanwhile the student at school had many conversation with other peer and teacher throughout the day the student who stayed at home lost of there overall social communication skill and did worse on a pop quiz about the information that wa being taught by their teacher this study exemplifies that if you were to stay at home and miss even just one day of school you would miss out on many social lesson like peer project and even just normal conversation that are experience that can strengthen you socially for the future while being at school you do not just learn about how to solve for x in mathematics or who won the mexican american war student subconsciously grow and learn more about their community throughout grade school there is this whole other community aspect of learning going on that most do not even notice what is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundred of people is that it is filled with family friend neighbor and even stranger meeting all of these people and learning new thing about them can really strengthen the school wide community connection advancement with technology also help u by letting student connect with other people in their community but technology also doesnt help u if we are letting student attend class online through video conference doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationship within a community going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmate through this safe environment at school cause a total downfall on community awareness going to school everyday and seeing you teacher and classmate is a prime and simple example of eye to eye learning eye to eye learning is basically being with another person in real life not over a screen and actually talking and learning form them almost every kid remembers at least one first day of school memory when they were little or even this past year well that connection you made with other student and your teacher wa an official eye to eye connection made unlike looking at a screen four hour on end while being taught having the physical opportunity to talk to your teacher either in a whole class discussion or one on one is much more effective than an email or text message there wa a study done by the freelance college in north dakota many certified scientist studied the difference between learning through video on a screen at home or being at school learning through a teacher both group were taught the same thing and took a ten question test on the lesson that the teacher had taught the statistic showed that student who stayed at home had a test average of while student who went to school had a test average of the student who worked on the computer at home had a shorter attention span because their teacher wa physically not at their house teaching them thus caused the at home student to do poorly on the test overall this study clearly show that student learn exceptionally better with eye to eye discussion in real life at school being able to communicate with a teacher one on one or in a class discussion really make a positive change in the student academic performance although being at home is a quiet place to focus in order for a student to fully develop into a successful person you have to have social skill community awareness and be able to understand eye to eye learning the way successor achieve these three skill easily is if you attend actual class and school related event student would not benefit anymore at home through virtual learning anymore than they do at school even though there are so many technology advancement school world wide need to realize that many staying simple is better and that student must always attend class in person in order to achieve greatness in the future',\n",

your teacher are this also mean that the teacher may not know who their student are because of this summer project should be student designed student can adress what area they need the extra practice in have a choice in what they learn and tey can emprove their learning by doing something they love each student may ave an easier time on one subject over another the further through schooling a student is the more apparnt this becomes take me and my sister for example i have a very difficult time in english and history due to the way they are tested apon i have a difficult time with test where there may be more than one right answer in a multiple choice senario finding the one question that is accurate v being or accurate is difficult for me thats why i can excell in mathmatics and the science there is only one right answer on the other hand my sister is the opposite she doe extreemly well in history and english and ha a difficult time in math and science this is evident in every person you will ever incounter each learns remembers and think differently from the next therefore teacher who have never met the student they are assigning work to should not have a part in a student summer learning my class may end up with alot of math practice and very little history this will help my sister greatly improve her math but i will still be behind on this history while others may be far ahead many might argure that all student should get the same work so it is fair this is entirely unrealistic it is not fair for me to get page of math and be able to finish it in five minute while it take my sister three hour it is not fair that i dont recieve the help i need in history because my sister need were put above mine with this in mind think about what school is truly here to do for the young generation that pas through it system yes school is here to encourage learing but in it basic foundation school is here to prepare u for the future take the book educated by tara westover for example tara never went to public school and receved very minial education from her parent thus when tara entered the real world she struggled grealty school is here to take some of this struggle away by teaching student skill and trade aswell a math and english this is alother reason why summer asignments should be student designed by having assignment be student designed they will learn to make choice in the real world you have to make hard decision and stick with your choice in the real world you have to choose what you need to do over what you want to do in the real world you have to put in the effort and show that you care even if you don t by giving student the choice of what they can work on by leaving assignment open ended it will teach them how to make good decision for their future the level of openness can be decided dy the school if need be but what come out should be the student idea with the freedom to choose what they learn based on their own need they will get the best education posible every person on earth learns significantly better when they enjoy what they are doing even me who doe not like history can learn it i have traviled all over asia and even lived in japan i lived on a small southern japanese island called okinawa while i wa ther i envested my self into learing everything i could about my home me who is terrible at history can tell you the histroy of okinawa back a thousand year to when the ryuku kingdom wa flourishing the only push i needed to be able to learn a difficult subject wa enjoyment when someone enjoys what they are learning and can connect with it they will learn much faster and much more by alowing student to control their summer assignment they can learn these difficult topic in a way they enjoy they may also take a new vew on something see something from another person perspective or find that they love a subject more than they previously thought maybe it through watching historicaly accurate movie like hacksaw ridge d day midway or war horse maybe it is through fun math riddle and compitions maybe it is by spending the day with a granpa and hearing his account of the war you can also begin to foucus in or figure out what you want to spend your life doing my grandfather wa a pilot and after year of hearing his and my mother story thats what i want to do i want to be a pilot like my grandfather and be in the military like my father i only want this because i have learned to love to travil from my parent and the military is where i grew up it is apart of me that ha only been nourished by what i have been alowed to learn and experience outside of a closed classroom by allowing student to design their own summer learning the student will learn to chose what is best for them adress their own need and enjoy what they are getting to learn this will open door for student that may never close it introduces them to real world aplications of what they sit in a closed room learing for most of the year it can help student interact with others more causing them to talk to people and make friend where they had non perviously maybe it will incourage student to try something new weather that be a new sport type of art instument or to try and write a book out of all of this it most siginificant effect is it introduces student to the joy of learing how the real world behaves and expose them to enumeral opprotunitys that will influence what the student will want to do with his her life it turn the child that inter school in pre k into adult',\n",

a million question and possibility fill your head would you rather go to disney world with your best friend or your significant other what about your brother uncle or mom with a problem like this you have to seek advice have you ever had an issue so tough that you needed to seek advice i know for certain that i have encountered this problem before with issue like that i always seek advice from numerous people before making my final decision i believe seeking multiple opinion can help someone make a better choice because you can hear other people s point of view determine what the best choice is by finding which answer is said most and learn life lesson from the people you seek advice from a big reason you should seek advice from more than one person is because you can hear different point of view by asking many people for advice on the situation you encounter people that are wiser smarter and far more experienced than yourself for example i remember encountering a situation a a fifth grader where i had to choose between saving my money or buying a new gaming system i had been saving this money since fourth grade and i had accumulated more than four hundred dollar when i went over to my cousin s house i wa able to play on his gaming system and i thought it wa really fun before i left i made sure to ask him if i should invest in the same gaming system or to save the money his response wa to buy the system even though i got the advice i needed i made sure to ask other people the same question next i remember asking my parent if it would be worth it my mom had told me that we already had lot of video game on the other hand my dad told me that it wa my money and if this is what i decided to spend is on it wa completely fine after seeking multiple point of view i had finally made my decision i wa going to buy the gaming system to this day i still play on that console and i do not regret my investment after asking many people you start to see a pattern in answer in my case i figured out that the majority of people i asked said it wa a good idea to buy the console and this lead into my next point asking many people for advice can also be beneficial because you can determine what the proper choice is by examining what answer people reply most if we go back to my story about whether or not to buy the console the answer i received most wa yes ultimately that wa a big factor that told me i should buy the console if you ask many people the same question and you get the same answer whatever they are telling you is probably the smart and correct thing to do it may not necessarily be the decision you were thinking of making but it may be one to consider back at the beginning of the school year my english teacher assigned our class a project where we have to make a difference in our community at first my idea wa to organize a community wide sport equipment drive when i got home that day i discussed my idea with my parent and they told me that wa not the best idea and that we should sit down and discus a better idea i decided i wanted to prove them wrong fast forward a couple of month and i am struggling to get anything done on the project that night i told my parent that my idea would not work and they just gave me that i told you so look from there we devised a plan where i would instead help the volunteer on the blue ridge parkway right now my project is going great and i am close to crossing the finish line of completion from that i learned that you need to take advice of others because in my case my parent knew what they were talking about if multiple people tell you that something is not the right choice then you should probably reconsider that wa a life lesson i needed to learn but from seeking advice from more than one person you learn many life lesson last but not least asking more than one person for advice can teach you very valuable life lesson that will help along the path of life from my experience of failure from my school project i learned that even though you think your idea sound good you should still be open to improvement my decision on buying something i wanted taught me opportunity cost from asking people for advice you can learn may valuable thing that will assist you not only do these decision affect a singular situation but they can be applied to life very easily now if i am interested in purchasing anything i always weigh the option and ask others what the best thing to do would be i learned that skill from asking people for advice these are the lesson that are learned first hand you do not just read them in a book but instead you are taught by experience and others after asking for advice from numerous people you ultimately decide that you want to take your brother with you to disney world though those people you did not choose may feel bummed out you know you made a good educated choice because you took advice not just from one person but from many if you had only asked one person they could have told you to take your grandfather dog cousin son etc instead asking many people gave you a better grasp on the situation ultimately allowing you to determine the best choice is to take your brother asking many people for advice before making a decision is a good choice because you can examine other people s opinion on the situation figure out what the best choice is by finding the most common answer and learn many life lesson so the next time you face a difficult choice ask more than one person for advice before coming up with your

think this is a good idea there are several reason why this doe not truly benefit student because it would ultamantly unprepare them for later in life firstly it is important that child learn responsibility young so they are prepared for adulthood another idea is with online school it make it very easy for these student to cheat on graded work finally with online school student can become too dependent on technology firstly child need to know responsibility to have a successful future the way we can truly prepare child to be successful is to install a responsible mindset one good way to get them there is to let them get themselves ready in the morning for school everyday a child who ha online school would not have to do the same necessity a a child who ha to go out everyday would the student who attends online learning would not have to get dressed everyday or even brush their teeth while the student who attends the brick and mortar school would have to get dressed make sure they practice good hygiene everyday and even pack their own lunch and book bag before leaving in the morning child who attend online school miss out on this crucial part of learning how to take care and be responsible for themselves next student could easily cheat if they have class online those who do class online are most likely not being supervised if they are not being supervised during a test what is stopping them from looking up answer on their phone with google taking photo of the lesson to use or even note on test some might answer this with their parent are home with them they aren t left unsupervised but most people today work a nine to five job everyday and don t have time to watch their child take a test for example i have a class online at my school everything is on the website provided by the school so student often cheat on their quiz and test in that class but because is it entirely online there is no way the teacher would know they are cheating if they finish a lesson at home but when it happens at the school or even in my other class the teacher easily know if someone is cheating on an assignment in return kid who cheat don t get the full reward of actually learning lastly student who do online schooling will eventually depend on technology too much while their class are taught with an actual teacher through video chat they will not stay that way forever some course are already completely internet based the lesson quiz and even test are all on the website it is important that child know how to do thing for themselves if their lesson is there wouldn t key point be emphasized how will they know what is important to get from a lecture if student attend an online school it just add to the list of thing that we rely on technology for child need to know how to do thing for themselves and not have the internet to do them for them for example amazon alexa she can do just about everything from turning the tv on to shop or even turn the microwave on for you if we rely on technology and add schooling to the list we are depriving our child to do basic thing on the other hand some may argue that online schooling help student who are on home bound kid often get hurt from participating in sport or just playing outside this result in them going on home bound from school child who are on home bound can benefit from online school by staying afloat in their class and also keeping in the seven to three schedule of learning but kid need social interaction social interaction is a vital part of development if student have school over the computer or video chatting they are not getting the proper interaction they need yes they would still see their parent everyday but kid need to mingle with people their age just like an adult doe not want to be with a five year old all day dose not mean that a five year old want to be with a forty year old all day we can t let child live online through their early year and throw them into the workforce later they will not be able to act right in public if you look at child who are home schooled their whole life they do not act the same a a child who went to public or private school the student who learn from home do not get the fight or flight mentality a a student who ha witnessed fight or lock down at school during in their life you can t shelter a child from the world by giving them online school they will not be able to survive therefore student do not benefit from online school while home bound student have the ability to prosper with the idea it is important that every student learns responsibility to get themselves ready for the day in the morning not being too dependent on technology and also not to cheat on assignment so they can fully learn but most importantly child need the crucial social interaction that is vital to healthy living without these factor a child would be unprepared to be a successful adult',\n",

although some believe otherwise student should be able to design their own project because they will have the creativity factor that controlled project would not they can choose their own subject and they have an increased growth in responsibility u student love the creativity aspect of getting to choose how we get to work we hate being bound to guideline and rule set by other people whenever i get to choose how i do my project i always seem to do better on them when i get to be more creative a couple of month ago my ap environmental science teacher let u choose an end of year project she said a long a you get it in on time i do not care what or how you do it the project just ha to pertain towards some of the topic that we learn during the course i loved getting that freedom from her because i got to do it how i wanted and i got to be more creative with it too i ended turning in that project within a month because it wa something that i wanted to do if i wa bound to the rule i would have procrastinated until the night before it wa due some may disagree saying that they are more likely to do the project when guideline are given and when student are forced not to be creative that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that my friend generic name wa given a similar project but with guideline saying the stuff that she could and could not do she ha always been better than me at turning in assignment when i found out that i had turned in my project before her i wa astonished i asked her why she had not not done yet she said that she had not even figured out what she wa going to do she wa bound to do what she wa told to do and she lost the creativity factor that she ha always loved creativity is vital to a student success when doing project it ensured that every project is different and more entertaining than traditional project getting to choose a subject also make the project more enjoyable for the student if student were given a choice to select a subject that they would do a summer project on they would most likely choose the subject that they feel more confident in my mother always say that she loved to do project on history which wa her favorite subject when she wa in high school she said that whenever she would get to do a project on it she would get a s and b s every time but she would get c s on other project that wa not on her favorite subject this choice in subject wa a morale booster for her when she got good grade she got more confident and when she got more confident she got better grade the choice correlated with her mental health and her school life because she always felt good about her work some say that if we get assigned a subject then we will be more likely to do what the person who grade is looking for that is not the case because of my friend generic name generic name had to do a summer project last year and he had no idea what to do he called me an asked what my project wa on i told him that me and just about everyone in our friend group wa doing our project on history when the school year started i asked him what he did it on and he said his project wa on economics when we got our grade back he had gotten the highest out of all of our friend this just show that it is more likely for someone to get a better grade when they get to choose a project subject or topic that they enjoy to do in our youthful society responsibility is a huge part of maturing getting to choose a project make kid more responsible in the long run this past weekend my parent left me home while they went to go watch my sister play lacrosse at generic school in rhode island i stayed home with my dog and had a lot of time to myself and to my study i could have pushed it off until sunday night but i decided to do the responsible thing and do it during the day on saturday the choice i made wa the right one because i had the rest of the weekend to myself and got to relax and not stress about having to do my homework if i can choose to be responsible now then i can be responsible when it come to a summer project i think that growth in responsibility will also have a great effect on everyone that doe this project the responsible person would choose to do the project earlier in the summer but the kid that procrastinate will stress about this until the day before the project is due some think that responsibility ha nothing to do with this project that is not true we are trusted to be responsible young men woman or however people identify themselves this project is not just about learning at school but learning about life when given the choice to do the project how we want to do it responsibility play a huge factor factor like will we get it done on time how will we do it what topic will we do it on and if the project actually had time spent on it or if it wa just sped through u student need to be responsible in order to get in to good college get good job and live good life it all start with project like these when all of these factor are put together they are more likely to make u more responsible in the long run when we get to choose what we do for project like these it make everyone feel good about what they are turning in it could be the coffee in my system talking but u student have responsibility and we need to start being trusted and treated like adult we want to be creative

Compared to their reasons on why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, they gave a lot more reasons on why it is dangerous. They greatly showed how the conditions on Venus are far more extreme than anything humans are used to. On the other hand, they explained very little on how it would benefit us and showed how it's mostly just out of curiosity.\\n\\nThe author provided many, many dangers that the pursuit of studying Venus presents. The text states, \\\"These conditions [on venus] are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth... additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on its surface.\\\" The author seems to thoroughly describe the dangers of visiting Venus by describing the high temperatures, the high atmospheric pressure, and other things humans are not used to. They also point out how Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, and how no spacecraft has survived a landing on Venus for more than a few hours. This is all a lot more information provided on the dangers compared to the information provided on the benefits for studing Venus.\\n\\nThe author explained very little on how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The text states, \\\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\\\" The author always seems to make a vague statement on how Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers but never provides any evidence. The author says the planet would gain us insight, but doesn't show how. The second part of their statement about human curiosity seems very careless; the author sounds like he/she is just curious to have more insight on Venus. The text also states, \\\"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.\\\" This statement could have been the start of a good reason on why Venus is a worthy pursuit. Venus could possibly be inhabited by humans in the future. However, the author does't explain this; they just begin to compare Venus to Earth.\\n\\nTo conclude, the author did not effectively support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They provided many of the dangers, showing how humans would not be able to handle the conditions. On the other hand, they did not thoroughly explain why Venus is still a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. They gave very vague statements but provided little to no evidence. They should have built on their reasons to show how the dangers of studying Venus don't matter as much as compared to the benefits of studying Venus. \",\n          \"  Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can improve the quality of life in urban areas. According to the passage set, car-free cities like Vauban in Germany and Paris, France have seen a significant reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions due to the absence of cars. Additionally, the number of miles driven in the United States has decreased steadily since 2005, indicating a shift away from car culture (Rosenthal). These trends suggest that limiting car usage can have numerous benefits for both the environment and public health.\\nOne of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is a reduction in air pollution. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, emitting harmful pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere (Rosenthal). By limiting the number of cars on the road, cities can significantly reduce air pollution and improve air quality, particularly in urban areas. For example, Vauban's car-free policy has led to a 70% reduction in air pollution compared to other areas of Freiburg (Rosenthal).\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change (Rosenthal). By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate the impacts of climate change. For example, Paris has seen a 22% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since implementing a partial driving ban (Duffer).\\nLimiting car usage can also improve public health. Cars emit harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which can have serious health consequences, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing respiratory\",\n          \"Dear. State senator\\n\\nI think we should banish the Electoral College becuse we the people decide who the president is not\\u00a0 Electorals. We should just go back to basics and have a normal vote system. This system is no working for our needs so we need a better and direct voting system. One big example for leting go of the Electoral college is the disater factor and it just unfair to voters.\\n\\nThe electoral college should be cancelled because there are too many things wrong with it. Like one is the winnner-take-all sytyem, by a couple of votes off and one canidate takes all the points in that state. So with that, canidates will use mostly of he's/her's attention on big states to get all the big points there. And little states see little to no campaign ads for any candidates because of the electoral college.\\n\\nThen swing states help us in the electoral college with dividing the points to the cadidates.\\n\\nHelp with the winner-take-all system, it just the oppisite of it. Also the electors rarely betrayed the voting. Then the are times where the candidate wins the elctoral vote, then loses the national popular vote.\\n\\nWith all of this infomation the Electoral College should be descarded because it is a non-democratic method and it just an anachronism. And when you are voting, you are voting for electors, not the priesident. And which candidate wins the popular vote wins the election. its just unfair to the voters because they dont really vote for the priesident.       \\u00a0    \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"AI\",\n          \"human\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 920,\n        \"min\": 448,\n        \"max\": 9977,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2671,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2448,\n          3075\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lexical_diversity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08474002813419791,\n        \"min\": 0.10238095238095238,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4996,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5111561866125761,\n          0.34276729559748426\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flesch_reading_ease\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 17.33483026509299,\n        \"min\": -289.87,\n        \"max\": 101.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1399,\n        \"samples\": [\n          33.68,\n          26.91\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
