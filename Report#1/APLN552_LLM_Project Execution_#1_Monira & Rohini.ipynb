       " 'when looking at the world from a bird eye view it is possible to see the beauty in the world even so in certain developed and developing area the people are choking the choking is not just supported by the violated environment but along with that society is an advocate for the pain of the people an intrugal part of the current society is the usage of car with the progressing world also come regress and according to an article written by the new york time in it wa stated that in country such a the united state of america american are buying le and getting fewer license a each year go by this eventually ha lead to a limiting in car usage in the u s a although the car industry may suffer from this it is essential to note that the limiting in car usage doe not really have a negative impact on the public in fact in the long run the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society a a whole this can be seen in three major way with first public benefit second cheaper and timesaving method and finally the unmatched environmental benefit a people continue to choke from the pain it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem and limiting car usage is the definitely one of the best way to reduce the harm the public benefit can be broken down into reduced stress more space and increased safety starting off with stress heidrun walter a mother of two child stated that she wa always tense when she had a car she now life in the german city of vauban here most people have given up on car including mr walter a a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation with mr walter businessman carlos arturo plaza stated that it s a good opportunity to take away stress these people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit moving toward space an article written by elisabeth rosenthal in state in this new approach we will have make it so there is le space for parking with le space for car there is more space for people not only that but with the increased limit there is a decrease in traffic traffic can be extremely long and in this case it will help to increase public space although traffic doe not pose threat to the people safety in the long term car accident do pose a major threat therefore with their limit there can be an increase in safety for the people moving back to mr walter she a a mother of two did want the best for her child and above all come their safety meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produce although people do want to benefit a individual it really come down to the cost at the end point but limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person in fact by limiting car alternate transportation is promoted country such a colombia have move on to bicycle the major of bogotaa city in colombia said that due to the limitation of car for a day it ha seen the constuction of mile of bicycle path this is cheaper because the price og bicycle are pale in comparison to car this mean that transport would be so much more affordable now with the increase in bicycle travel there would hardly be any large amount of traffic and although car are much faster than bicycle the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel bicycle travel will be more efficient this ultimately mean that by limiting car usage transportation will be cheaper and it will be just a efficient if not more it can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel but david goldberg an offical of transportation for america said that in country such a the u s a of appropriation have gone to highway this ultimately set the stone for the construstion of these lane by limiting car usage these appropriation can be set aside for other mean of transportation indeed in the end vauban is correct in calling this smart planning now come out the benefit everyone know about the environmental benefit smog ha been one of the largest problem that is choking the people around the world in country such a china it is elementary that those people a facing large amount of smog daily but what may not be a common to people is that a country such a france ha also started to see a similiar problem pollution in france is actually rivaled by beijingone of the most polluted country in the world a reported by the chicago tribune on car have been the major cause of this considering the fact that a large amount of carbon emission were sent out by car in fact an article named the end of car culture state that car are one of the highest source for carbon emission by limiting car usage city such a bogota and paris faced amazing result overall by limiting car usage the environment benefit exponentially in the end the solution to the people choking in the world is simple limiting car usage the advantage of this limitation can be seen with benefit to socitey this can be seen with public benefit cheaper and time saving method and of course the environmental benefit',\n",

       " 'dear state senator once a year people all over the united state of america gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our president and vice president we should have the people of america be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the electoral college ha some major flaw and simply because people have their right i believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choice the electoral college ha major flaw something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people s decision source a in paragraph state in a shift of just vote would have deadlocked the election in a tie would have occurred if a mere voter in ohio and voter in hawaii had voted the other way the election is literally only a few swing voter away from a catastrophe it would be hard to believe that the people of the united state would want to be embarrassed because we can t even choose a presidential leader correctly the other country would take u a a joke we would simply look like fool another thing is what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote source b also in paragraph say perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote and with that being said the election would be taken to the hor house of representative where state delegation vote on the president and because each state cast only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing only voter would have much to say a the representative from california who represents million that is the same population a wyoming only time that is a tremendous difference in population don t let our country plummet into bad election if anyone ha a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hand of a few swing voter in ohio they have yet to make it ever since our founding father have settled here in america and made the decloration of independence in the late s the amendment and everything that give u the right to be free the people have had the right to vote with the electoral college the people of america will not be able to freely use that right source c say at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voter because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidate don t spend time in state they know they have a chance of winning focusing only on the right race in the swing state seventeen state didn t even see the candidate during the campaign in those state including rhode island and south carolina voter in the of the largest medium market didn t get to see not one not two but zero campaign ad just a source d state the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the fiasco wa the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse the state legislature are technically responsible for picking elector and keep in mind that those elector possibly could defy the will of the people what if a state sends two state of elector to congress it happened in with hawaii and luckily vp richard nixon validated only his opponent s elector but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent what if it happened again remember when al gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to george w bush thank that to the electoral college in the u s presidential race al gore recieved more individual vote that george w bush nationwide but bush won the election recieving electoral vote to gore s this year voter can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet the electoral college still ha it defender but why first of all source e state so other thing being equal a large state get more attention from presidential candidate in a campaign than a small one doe but the problem with this is is that it s simply unfair the smaller state should get just a much attention a the bigger state do this is like saying that on the baseball field the bigger and stronger kid should be the one picked first and be able to play but the smaller kid don t get to play it is not fair to the people in the smaller state like wyoming to be considered not a good a the state of california also in paragraph of source f say they are the most thoughtful voter on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidate and the most thoughtful voter should be the one to decide the election once again this statement is unfair this is favoritism this is saying that the better and bigger state should get all the attention just because they are more thoughtful once again people deserve to have their right so i say let them vote people want to make their own decision it s who we are a a person we want to be able to have responsibility we want to feel important with the electoral college we won t be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren t important enough to vote so it s official the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational the best argument in favor of it are mostly assertion without much basis in reality and the argument against direct election are spurious at best over percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there s a pretty good reason it s fair there s only one thing i have to say to you state senator please abolish the electoral college',\n",

columbia paris germany or even the united state of america not all country have taken part in trying to reduce the use of car to an all time low that may just be their own choice while other country are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reason some place in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world and if you think about it if half of the world tryed a hard a they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted i know car aren t the only thing that cause pollution but it a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are in vauban germany a suburban area ha almost completely given up driving and even owning a car car ownership is allowed but there are only two place to park rosenthal but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space carowners can buy a space for along with a home rosenthal that price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together

example in this article called by robert duffer on monday motorist with even numbered license plate were told to leave their car at home or suffer a euro fine which turn out to be u s dollar and then the same thing would happen to those whose license plate ended in an odd number the following day this had to have cut pollution a huge amount if you think about how many people are living in paris and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn t produced during this ban now paris did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it it couldn t have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn t really help that much out of the whole city of paris about driver were fined and people had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine duffer another advantage that paris had due to them banning car usage wa that congestion wa down percent duffer the ruling french lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough bogota columbia turned what they did a a tradition into a big hit to ton of

transportation due to all the taxi and the subway not many people in new york city drive or even own a car due to the congested street and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it wa in germany crazy amount of money to park a car is just an outrage the advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it another one would be the traffic is bad but not a bad a it would be if more people had car public transportation is huge in new york it s already expensive enough to live in new york imagine if there werent a many taxi and if the subway wasn t there at all picture all the pollution there would be to wrap up everything a stated there are many advantage to reducing car usage all around the world if it wa to reduce smog or pollution of

abide by it according to reuters an international news agency in london almost driver were fined and people had their vehicle impounded because of their reaction to the fine it is a shame that people

buffer s article wa published he state last week paris ha microgram of particulate matterpm per cubic meter compared with in brussels and in london reuters found also in paris diesel fuel is used more than gasoline diesel engine take more energy to burn the gas which cause more pollution than just normal gasoline according to reuters france ha a tax policy that favor diesel over gasoline in france

biggest city in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day what if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item you can change your whole environment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive mile down the road the law that wa put affect in paris france doe not state that you can never drive your vehicle again it is just simply asking the citizen to go one day without their vehicle but what if i have to go somewhere such a work school or anywhere else that i want paris is a large city that much is understood because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from point a to point b one way is public transportation from the city andor local business like a bus or tram according to the bbc public transit wa free of charge from friday to monday a well so if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem if you do not like public transportation or do not prefer it you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay also you are getting exercise out of it which benefit your health walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many way if you see someone familiar walking towards you you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going a well a this if you see a small shop or stand that spark your interest you have easier access to explore inside if you were drivingriding in a vehicle then

thing you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed a study discovered by elisabeth

just can not afford it which in the long run save them money anyway maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car maybe taking public transportation is not a crowded and a much of a hassle a the movie make it seem taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different background a well you can meet someone that you might not see a a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new name with public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving the question still remains why not limiting your vehicle usage doe not limit your option and exposure to the outside world having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either some vehicle are eco friendly and are built so they can help protect the environment sadly however most are not built and designed that way driving is so stressful for a person you have to focus on

microgram of particle matter per cubic meter comparing this to other major city in europe that find more use for regular gasoline you ll find that the result are le in brussels there were microgram of
