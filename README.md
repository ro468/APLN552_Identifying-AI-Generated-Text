# AI-Generated Text Detection  

This project aims to develop machine learning models to detect AI-generated text from human-generated text.  

## Introduction  

With the rise of AI-generated content, there is a growing need to distinguish between text generated by artificial intelligence systems and text authored by humans. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to classify text samples as either AI-generated or human-generated.  

## Methodology:  

Three machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated for essay classification:  
• Naïve Bayes  
• Logistic Regression  
• Random Forest  
• BERT  


Feature engineering techniques were employed to augment the dataset and enhance classification performance. Three key features were engineered:  
• Text Length  
• Lexical Diversity  
• Flesch Reading Ease  


Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy were used to assess the performance of each classifier.
