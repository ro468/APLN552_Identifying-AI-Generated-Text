# AI-Generated Text Detection  

This project aims to develop machine learning models to detect AI-generated text from human-generated text.  

## Introduction  

With the rise of AI-generated content, there is a growing need to distinguish between text generated by artificial intelligence systems and text authored by humans. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to classify text samples as either AI-generated or human-generated.
